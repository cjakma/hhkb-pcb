One of the biggest issues I've run into with making mechanical keyboard PCBs has been finding the correct component footprints. This KiCad library is aimed at being a comprehensive collection of footprints for anyone hoping to make a mechanical keyboard PCB.

### Credits
* Base MX footprints come frome the [forked library](https://github.com/stormbard/Keyboard.pretty) by [Eric Bunton](https://github.com/stormbard)

### Coming soon
* Various USB connectors (Type A/B/C, micro, mini)
* Resistor, diode, LED SMDs (0603, 0805 etc)
